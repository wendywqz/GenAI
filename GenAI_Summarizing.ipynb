For instance; Slight changes in the code (spaces, repeated codes of questions identification, lack of use of the proposed functions...) derive on fail to pass. Error information are frequently uninformative. It is not possible to check part of the code (see W4)The use of \"Slack\" is not proper; information it is not easily accessible, unorganized and it demands on students the learning of new tools and additional payments.Definitively I used more time with the code than with the NLP contentHopefully this comment is useful for students and teachers.Thanks a lotThis is helpful (32)', \"Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Sarvesh K•Jun 18, 2020i would have liked if the week 4's LSH and Approximate Hashing was explained more clearly.This is helpful (25)\", 'Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Achkan S•Aug 29, 2020This course has too many problems as it stands:1) They haven\\'t chosen an audience: the concept that they explain are trivial for anyone having (even basic) machine learning (or even basic linear algebra) knowledge. However, it doesn\\'t meant that this explanations would be useful for beginners: they are too short and incomplete (the \"videos\" are on average 3 minutes long!!) and what they focus on is often not the most relevant part.2) There is no reading material: no books, no papers, no theory. It wouldn\\'t be a problem if the videos themselves were decent, but most of them are about 1 minute long. You can\\'t explain machine learning in such a short time.3) The code of the assignments, especially assignment 4, is unclean (e.g. unused variables) and contains minor bugs.4) The script that grades the assignments has very strict requirements: as an example, very often, if you use x.dot(A) instead of np(x,A), then it complains and says you\\'ve failed. This happens for a lot of numpy functions, and it makes the process of submitting results tedious.5) Again, regarding the course material itself, many of the key aspects are not discussed. For example, word embeddings are given that have some nice properties, but its never explained how they have been obtained.Overall, it seems completely rushed.This is helpful (24)', 'Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Oleh S•Jun 26, 2020Quiet good starting course for those who decided to study NLP. Materials are qualitative, but also too short.  The course lacks of depth, lectures are too simple, hence in order to deepen knowledge and understanding one have to read a lot of additional resources, which are not provided here. I have  ambiguous impressions about this course. Seems, the best DeepLearning.ai courses are those taught by Prof. Andrew Ng.To sum up, I think, lectures duration should be increased and more deep intuition should be provided. Programming assignments are peace of cake for experienced programmer, but are OK for beginners. Also, there are many incomprehensible mistakes in programming tasks, which I suppose will be fixed later. Nevertheless, I recommend this course for those who want to start a journey to NLP world.This is helpful (19)', 'Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Agrita G•Jul 1, 2020The course is interesting and useful, however I have to admit that I was expecting more.

I think there are two main issues.  1) The choices about what to dive deep on were not helpful.

There can be better balance and error output explanations. More test cases for the assignments are needed to verify intermediate function outputs. Also, sometimes the course instructor mentions that you do not have to understand this concept or you can easily look it up online. This is not very encouraging because of course, one can look things up on the internet. It would be better suited to explain things however briefly it may be.

The basic ideas are well presented.  Some references for the details of vector subspaces and spanning vectors would have filled out the mathematical framework.This is helpful (2)', 'Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Robert S•Jul 24, 2020General Comments on Course 1All of the linguistic and semantic knowledge that we were mining in Course 1 was encoded in the vectors.  The coding was just using statistical methods to draw linguistic inferences from these vectors.  I find it unfortunate that we didn\\'t have an opportunity to learn how the vectors themselves are made (or did I miss something?), but merely got them out of a can from Google.It took me a while to figure out that the homeworks are graded by an AI, not a TA, and that one can submit the homework assignments numerous times until getting the grade you want.  Given the large number of students enrolled, I can understand that hand grading would not be an option.  It would probably be helpful to explain this to newcomers like me.I liked the way the assignments are structured. the fill-in-the-blanks approach, followed by some sort of numerical unit test to let us know if our solution was correct is good pedagogy (androgogy?).  My only criticism is that sometimes the unit tests are not very sensitive to common coding errors.  But now I know that we always have the option of running our assignment through the autograder for more complete feedback.The autograder is often overly prescriptive.  For example, \"Function \\'np.sign or np.heaviside\\' not found in Code Cell UNQ_C17.\"  Python is a rich language and there are many ways to code C17 without using those particular functions.  The goal should be to get students to solve a problem creatively -- not to follow a particular path.I found the week 4 assignment a real bear -- too long (22 completion sections) in comparison with the others.  I\\'m sure it was difficult for whoever codes the autograder as well.  They need to do some more code checking.  In UNQ__C8 we were asked to use the pre-coded cosine_similarity function.  Initially this was returning the cosine difference, which is quite the opposite.  In the middle of last week, after I and others reported the error, it was corrected but this seems to have created a cascade of other errors.  For example, in cell UNQ_C9, We are toldExpected Output:[[9 9 9] [1 0 5] [2 0 1]] Which is wrong.  A look at the vectors is enough to see that  (2,0,1) is closest to (1,0,1) by cosine similarity.  I believe the autograder makes the same confusion.  I mention this not to criticize our hard-working programmer, who is otherwise doing an excellent job, but so that the errors get fixed ;-) (edited)This is helpful (2)', 'Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Фридман Р Г•Jul 5, 2020Pretty simple course with some basic concepts superficially explained.
